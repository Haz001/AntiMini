# AntiMini
## A antivirus software for download and Database of MD5 hashes that it uses
### Antimini is a free antivirus that i have created with Visual studios, it is easy to use and runs scans at a ok speed. This is a program that you should not use on its own as it is not reliable and has a few bugs that need to be ironed out. So far it can detect 700,000 harmful files and can check any filetype.
## pros
### can scan multipul types of files
### can find 700,000 harmful files
### 100% free
### very small size (371 KB (13/07/2017))
### will notify you once the scan is done (this only works for file scans at the moment but will be added soon to the folder scan)
## cons
### every empty file (filesize of 0 bytes) it finds will be classed as a virus due to a error with the algrithem
### still haven't implemented a move window box feture so you will have to deal with the windows where ever they pop up
### it is a working progect
### it's algrithem is very basic
### The update feture doesn't work

## other info
this was just a small project i started a long time ago (2016) and it was created in VB and didn't use threading and used a slow algrithem so it was very slow and froze and crashed a lot and i gave up and didn't upload it but then after learning more and coming a better programer i decided to remake it from scratch but in c# and used threading and a new algrithem.
